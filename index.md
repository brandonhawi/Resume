# Brandon Hawi's Resume Project
---
Hello, my name is Brandon Hawi and this is my personal resume project!

## What?

This project is an attempt by me to shape my resume toward the jobs I am applying for! Each position I apply for, I 
do the following:
* Create a new directory for that position
* Clone my MASTER resume to that directory
* Shave away unnecessary details from my MASTER resume to create a concise, relevant resume

## Why?

I primarily created this repository to practice my use of Git versioning and also aid me in my job search this upcoming year. 
I created this web page for the repository to practice using GitHub pages as I plan to do create pages like this once I have 
*much* cooler projects to show off!
